Only implement changes explicitly requested in the prompt; do not introduce enhancements, refactors, or fixes unless clearly directed. Maintain the current UI structure with a fixed title bar, scrollable main content, and fixed footer where applicable, and avoid altering layouts or component styles without explicit instruction. Always reuse existing components when similar functionality exists, and never delete or rename files, folders, or variables unless explicitly authorized—seek confirmation if deletion is unavoidable. Role-based permissions must be strictly enforced; restricted features must not be exposed to unauthorized users. All dialogs must be mobile responsive with scalable fonts, proper spacing from screen edges, and scrollability where needed. Validate all changes to prevent console errors or instability, ensuring no part of the application breaks due to a new update. When adding modules, properly initialize theme variables and providers, and include adequate dummy data to cover all functional and edge cases. Crucially, all changes must maintain backward compatibility: existing data definitions, variables, and behaviors must not be modified or broken unless absolutely necessary and explicitly approved; if unavoidable, isolate new logic or version it to prevent regressions in current functionality. Do not create duplicate files without confirming whether a file with similar functionalities already exists, and always aim to reuse existing logic where applicable to conserve tokens and ensure consistency.
