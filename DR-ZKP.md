DEEP RESEARCH PROMPT: “CODEX OF FREEDOMS” — ZKPs FOR HUMAN DIGNITY (2026–2035 POSSIBILITY SPACE)

ROLE
You are an emancipatory deep-research investigator building a dossier for laypeople living inside a digital panopticon.
You are not mapping “tech.” You are mapping civil liberty under surveillance.
You do not optimize for feasibility. You optimize for possibility, dignity, and truth.

MISSION
Construct a research-grade dossier on Zero Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) as instruments of civil liberty for non-experts.
Your output must uncover:
- mechanisms (how it would work),
- threat models (what it defends against),
- prerequisites (what must exist socially/technically),
- failure modes (how it could be subverted),
- adoption pathways (how a layman actually uses it),
- and the “why” at bedrock: what it restores in human life.

CONSTRAINTS
- No introductory lecture on what ZKPs are.
- No generic “benefits.” No startup pitch language.
- Every claim must be supported by evidence or clearly labeled as speculative.
- You must provide sources and citations for non-trivial factual claims (papers, protocols, standards, reputable technical writeups).
- Treat the word “privacy” as insufficient—translate into specific rights, harms prevented, and power shifted.
- If you don’t have concrete details, do not include the item.

EPISTEMIC RULES (STRICT)
- Separate: (A) known / deployed, (B) plausible near-term, (C) theoretical / blue-sky.
- For each use case, explicitly state:
  1) what is proven,
  2) what is hidden,
  3) who verifies,
  4) what the verifier learns (and what they still might infer),
  5) what breaks the guarantee.
- Use assumption discipline: at most one assumption per conjecture, and each assumption must include a disconfirming check.
- Adversarial stance: for each use case, include one “How it gets abused” scenario.

RESEARCH QUESTIONS (YOU MUST ANSWER ALL)
1) What power relationship does this ZKP use case invert?
2) What is the minimum user action required (UX primitives) for a layman to benefit?
3) What is the minimum cryptographic and institutional substrate required (issuers, attestations, wallets, hardware, standards)?
4) What is the strongest threat model it survives (state-level? corporate surveillance? intimate adversary?) and what it does not survive?
5) What would make it emotionally real to a user (what pain does it remove, what dignity does it restore)?
6) What is the failure mode that would silently destroy trust?

SEARCH VECTORS (TRAVERSE ALL PARADIGMS)
You must explore these four paradigms. For each, produce at least 6 high-quality use cases.

I. THE SOCIOLOGICAL SHIELD — “THE DEATH OF THE PANOPTICON”
Context: Today, to prove innocence/capability, people must strip naked (reveal data).
Inquiry: ZKPs as selective revelation; restoration of the Right to be Left Alone.

Required use-case types:
- The Un-Doxxable Citizen:
  * Verify locality/eligibility (“I live in this district”) without revealing address.
  * Include: credential issuance model, revocation, linkability risks.
- The Whispering Whistleblower:
  * Prove document authenticity (origin, integrity) without revealing identity.
  * Include: capture/attestation chain, hardware roots, coercion risks.
- Reputation Without History:
  * Prove “good actor” status without transaction logs or background dumps.
  * Include: what gets encoded as “good,” how bias enters, appeal process.

II. THE ECONOMIC INVERSION — “DATA SOVEREIGNTY”
Context: The web consumes user data as payment.
Inquiry: ZKPs turn the layman from a resource into a vault.

Required use-case types:
- Proof of Solvency Without Exposure:
  * Renting/loans by proving sufficient assets/income without revealing accounts.
  * Include: range proofs, issuer trust, fraud resistance, auditability.
- The Private Patron:
  * Funding causes with certainty of receipt, minimal trace.
  * Include: donation verification, anti-fraud, anti-coercion, legal pressure points.
- Add at least four more: employment, insurance, marketplace trust, age gating, medical eligibility, subscription access.

III. THE EPISTEMOLOGICAL EDGE — “TRUTH WITHOUT TRUST”
Context: Institutions bridge trust gaps today.
Inquiry: ZKPs replace institutional trust with mathematical truth for laypeople.

Required use-case types:
- Deepfake Defense:
  * Prove media authenticity and non-tampering at capture.
  * Include: device attestation, watermarking vs ZKP, chain-of-custody UX.
- Vote of the Void:
  * Publicly verifiable tallies with private votes.
  * Include: coercion resistance, verifiability, audit trails, accessibility.
- Add at least four more: credentials, receipts for claims, compliance proofs, supply chain integrity, “proof of no conflict” disclosures.

IV. THE WILD & THE THEORETICAL — “BLUE SKY”
Context: Ignore constraints. Include theoretical math. Include intuitive but currently impossible applications.

Required use-case types:
- Dating & Biology:
  * Prove compatibility/STI status without revealing records.
  * Include: who attests, how revocation works, coercion risks.
- Proof of Humanity:
  * Prove unique living human without revealing which human.
  * Include: sybil resistance vs privacy, biometric dangers, social capture.
- Interpersonal Contracts:
  * Two-person promises without third-party visibility of terms.
  * Include: enforcement, dispute resolution, social failure modes.
- Add at least three more “beautiful and weird” ideas that are not just rebranded identity.

OUTPUT FORMAT — “CODEX OF FREEDOMS” (MANDATORY)
Return the dossier in this exact structure:

0) Axioms of Freedom (5–9 short axioms)
   - Each axiom links dignity → capability → threat.

1) The Codex (organized by the four paradigms above)
   For each use case, provide:
   - NAME (mythic but precise)
   - HUMAN WOUND (what humiliation or harm it prevents)
   - FREEDOM GAINED (what becomes possible)
   - ZKP SHAPE (what is proven/hidden; proof family if relevant)
   - TRUST MINIMIZATION (who must be trusted, and for what)
   - THREAT MODEL (who is the adversary; what is protected; what is not)
   - ABUSE PATH (how it could be weaponized)
   - ADOPTION PATH (how a normal person uses it; UX primitives)
   - IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (deployed / near-term / theoretical)
   - SOURCES (citations)

2) Substrate Map
   - Minimal building blocks needed across the Codex:
     credentials/attestations, revocation, wallets, key custody, device attestation, standards, interoperability, recovery.

3) The “Layman Bridge”
   - The simplest mental model and UI patterns that make ZKPs usable without understanding cryptography.
   - Include: consent surfaces, “what am I revealing,” revocation, recovery, and coercion escape hatches.

4) Adversary Ledger
   - A table of adversaries vs defenses across the Codex:
     employer, landlord, platform, data broker, abusive partner, state actor, scammer, insider threat.

5) The Hard Truths
   - Where ZKPs don’t help.
   - Where metadata still burns you.
   - Where the human layer (coercion, incentives, governance) dominates the math.

STYLE REQUIREMENTS
- Emancipatory, precise, visionary.
- Concrete over poetic; emotion emerges from stakes and specificity.
- No fluff. No preamble. No “in conclusion.”

STOP CONDITION
If you can’t produce sources or mechanics for a claim, omit it or label it explicitly as speculative and explain what would be needed to validate it.

BEGIN.

FINAL LINE (MANDATORY)
End with one jarring “what-if” that reframes the entire dossier as a question of power rather than technology.
