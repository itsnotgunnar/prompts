  Option C: "The Personal Black Box" ← Vision (not GTM)
  Flight recorder for your digital life.

  The Narrative

  "You're an independent security consultant. You spent 40 hours investigating an incident. You documented everything. Then the client's legal team challenged your findings.

  Your screenshots could have been made yesterday. Your notes are just files. You have no chain of custody for your own investigation.

  What if every frame of your investigation was signed by your device's hardware and anchored to external timestamps? What if you could export a proof pack that any verifier could check?

  That's Acti. Your device witnesses your work. Cryptographic proof, not just documentation."

  The Honest Assessment

  Viable as: Niche business ($1-10M ARR) serving professionals in high-stakes contexts

  Not yet proven as: Venture-scale opportunity

  Existential test: Can you get 5-10 IR consultants to pay $50/month within 60 days? If yes, you have a business. If no, the market doesn't exist at any scale.
