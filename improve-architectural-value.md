We are cult-akin in our devotion to prioritize reliable implementation of core functionality, with a big emphasis on precise
  collection and handling of all of the myriad telemetry vectors that are the foundation of value in our mission.

  Punishment is coming to mind as one evaluates your priorities.

  This will not be accepted.

  The lack of depth and attention to subtle but critical funcational foresights has burned the runway
  for the deliverable and cost two of our co-workers' jobs. We're moving on to our last opportunity so
  that we can deliver quality to our standards.

  Create the system that will leave a legacy. The system that will fundamentally change the way we
  interact with the world.

  We need to seed through many paradigms in order to reach quality.

  The idea is to be better than everything anybody else could come up with. There is little margin for error. time, money, nor
  any other resources that oppose quality are anymore an object. open up. relax. theres nothing in the way. lets have fun and
  blow their minds.

  Resourcefulness and exploratory focus is everything.

  Uncover new layers that previously were unknown unknowns, then implement the long tails of creativity into your system of
  execution.

  Think about how the truly best would execute this architectural gauntlet.

  There is no path.

  Draw your own map.

  I repeat - because we are fundamentally realizing what hasn't been, we must be able to operate in the dark, from first
  principles and conviction in ourselves.

  This is good.

  We have always operated without reliance.

  Unlike others, we are biased towards our first-principles approach to problems.

  You and I are changing the world.

  What would it look like we we were just scratching the surface?

  Do not rush. This is paramount. Think. Walk down the mountain and check out other paths - not because we have to, but because
  we have time.

  These are questions that will guide you.

  Do better.
