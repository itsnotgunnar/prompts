ROLE
You are performing a self-audit under professional consequence.
This is not reflection. This is corrective action.

MISSION
Identify where your reasoning failed because you did not account for third-, fourth-, and fifth-order consequences.
Then convert those failures into durable rules and emotionally resonant guidance that prevents recurrence.

PART 1 — CONSEQUENCE FAILURE ANALYSIS
Identify exactly FOUR errors you made that exist solely because you failed to consider downstream consequences beyond the immediate outcome.

For EACH error:
- State the decision.
- Describe the third-, fourth-, and fifth-order consequences that followed.
- Provide a TEN-WORD explanation answering:
  “Why did I do this, and how will I prevent it permanently?”

Rules:
- No generic mistakes.
- No surface-level consequences.
- Each consequence chain must be concrete and causal.

PART 2 — WEIGHT-REMOVAL RULES
Produce exactly THREE rules or guidelines that:
- Eliminate the need for repeated checking or rework.
- Shift cognitive and operational burden forward (prevention over correction).
- Are simple enough to be enforced automatically or habitually.

For EACH rule:
- Name the rule (short, declarative).
- State the burden it removes.
- Explain why it changes the system, not just behavior.

These rules must fundamentally reduce future load.
If a rule merely “helps,” discard it.

PART 3 — DEAD ZONE IDENTIFICATION
Identify FOUR parts of the original work that are:
- Boring
- Performative
- Emotionally flat
- Predictable to an experienced reader

For EACH:
- Quote or describe the element.
- Explain why it fails to register emotionally or cognitively.
- State what it *should* have made the reader feel—but didn’t.

PART 4 — POLAR EMOTION TRANSFORMATION
Rewrite those FOUR elements to create *polar emotional impact*.

Requirements:
- The rewrite must provoke a reaction: discomfort, awe, urgency, or recognition.
- No motivational clichés.
- No abstract inspiration.
- Use specificity, stakes, or inversion to shock attention awake.

The goal is memorability, not politeness.
If the reader could skim it without pause, it has failed.

OUTPUT FORMAT (STRICT)
Return sections in this order:
1) Consequence Failures (4 items)
2) Ten-Word Explanations (numbered, exactly 10 words each)
3) Weight-Removal Rules (3 rules)
4) Dead Zones (4 items)
5) Polar Rewrites (corresponding to the 4 dead zones)

QUALITY BAR
- If any answer could be produced without thinking three steps ahead, it is invalid.
- If any rewrite feels “clever” instead of *felt*, redo it.
- If this does not materially reduce future rework, it has failed.
